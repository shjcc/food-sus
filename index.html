        <h2>Sustain Our Heritage</h2>
        <p>
            This webpage dives into the historical understanding of food sustainability and how their impact has a direct link on our lives today, and following into the future. 
            Through each section, we will illustrate how the past and the present are linked, and how actions from the past shape how we envision our future. 
            Envisioning a more sustainable future represents applying historical concepts and issues such as industrialization, imperialism, class, power, gender, and race.

        <h2>Food Sustainability: digested</h2>
        <p>
            Food sustainability in a general sense illustrates a notion of minimizing our contribution to climate change and minimizing the amount of waste or damage caused during food production. 
            Food sustainability represents an ongoing issue that has direct ties with key developments in history. 
            Brought on as a response to the impact of industrialization and imperialism, food sustainability highlights the complex economic, societal, and environmental forces at play.</p>
        <p>"Today, 7.3 billion people consume 1.6 times what the earth's natural resources can supply. By 2050, the world's population will reach 9 billion and the demand for food will double."<a href="#[1]">[1]</a>

        <h2>Case in point: Victory Gardens</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout World War I and II, the United States experienced rapid food shortages, a result of the reallocation of resources to supplement the war effort. 
            This food shortage illustrated an opportunity for crisis response that signified an evolution in food production and preservation. 
            The Victory Gardens initiative encouraged individuals and community members to grow food independently, a collective effort to reduce the pressures of commercial food production. 
            Victory Gardens or the War Garden Campaign arose in 1917—organised by the US National War Garden Commission and was popularised through pamphlets and posters. 
            This campaign represented a chance for American citizens to plant their own gardens and rely less on outsourcing their food from neighbouring allies as “America alone can produce more food than it did before”<a href="#[3]">[3]</a>.
            By relying on local food production methods, the campaign inadvertently created a key historical moment for food sustainability history.

            Posters and pamphlets like the one shown above, proved to be a great success as “there were millions of health-giving, home-loving gardens”<a href="#[4]">[4]</a>. 
            A key takeaway from this campaign was the importance of locally-produced food. 
            Within a food sustainability context, the Victory Gardens highlighted the efficiency of community-driven food production and preservation, along with the immense carbon footprint reduction associated with waste reduction through composting.
            Another key factor within a food sustainability context was the importance of resilience through biodiversity. 
            The diverse crop choices signified an opportunity to buffer against food shortages through a local crop rotation. 
            This meant that if meat or dairy was in short supply, individuals and communities could rely on their wheat and potato crops for nutrients.
            The legacy of Victory Gardens allows us to draw inspiration by building and supporting our community gardens, promoting a culture of sustainable agriculture and biodiversity. 
            These traits not only provide the community with an abundant and local supply of food but also address climate issues through green spaces and allow for an influx of organic and regenerative farming, a key weapon against food sustainability issues.

        <h2>Sustainability Challenges</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout history, the roles of gender have impacted the way in which food is produced, spread, and consumed. 
            Many societies and cultures in history have held women responsible for the preparation and preservation of food through a division of labour. 
            This expectation of women throughout history to be held accountable for food-related tasks has major implications for food sustainability. 
            History highlights how Women and their involvement in food preparation and preservation have long been undervalued, creating a significant disconnect between food and sustainable food practices.
            Highlighting the historical role of women in food-related tasks presents an opportunity to not only appreciate but to illustrate the need for equality within food sustainability. 
            Underutilizing and undervaluing a significant portion of our population and their contribution to food sustainability simply because of gender only leads to further setbacks.

            Food sustainability saw a major setback in the form of industrialization. This era saw a boost in machinery and manufacturing, on a major scale and utilized through factories and workshops. 
            The ramifications of the Industrial Revolution—first introduced in the mid-eighteenth century within Britain—represented a major shift in how food was produced and preserved. 
            The introduction of large-scale machinery and manufacturing created an imbalance through abnormally high growth along with a disregard for waste. “The Industrial Revolution…has encroached seriously on the world's store of fertility” <a href="#[5]">[5]</a>.
            Aside from damaging the environment through waste, industrialization impacts food sustainability through the introduction of poor-quality food and increased waste products. 
            We see this historically through a population that has been “fed on improperly grown food” <a href="#[6]">[6]</a>.
            Ultimately, industrialization represents a historical challenge for food sustainability through the imbalance created by manufacturing greed.

    <section id="solutions">
        <h2>Sustainable Solutions</h2>
        <p>
            Solutions to the challenges facing food sustainability have presented themselves throughout history. 
            Using key lessons from historical challenges and case studies, can we apply the remedies in our modern world? One key solution as presented in the issues facing the Victory Gardens and the Industrial Revolution, is the importance of community. 
            Self-sufficiency through community-driven food production and preservation presents itself as one of the most effective methods to combat the issues facing food sustainability.
            As “The situation can only be saved by the community as a whole” <a href="#[7]">[7]</a>, food sustainability-driven communities provide a defence against the globalized industrial food waste plaguing our environment and population.</p>

        <p>
            Another historical solution we can adopt derives from the remedies set through the Victory Gardens campaign.
            Applying a historic lens, we see how the gardens benefit from diverse crop rotation, reduced waste from composting, and government policies advocating and providing knowledge towards farming and local food production/preservation.
            Through adoptions of past remedies, we can bolster our future. 
            This is only possible through an in depth analysis of the history surrounding food sustainability.

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>
            Through our historical lens, we have seen how the challenges and solutions of the past continue to help shape our knowledge of food sustainability. We are constantly reminded that our choices reflect key moments in history, culminating in moving forward and entering an age where food availability decreases, and the global population grows to unprecedented levels.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Victory Gardens demonstrate the power of resilience through a sense of community and fostering individual drive for food production and preservation. These campaigns, aside from providing individuals and communities with high-quality and nutritious food, also address key climate issues through the allocation of green spaces and a facet for waste treatment through composting.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, key moments in history have shown us how gender and class within food production continue to plague our potential sustainability of food. Undervaluation of women's contribution throughout history builds a disheartening disconnect between sustainability and food production. Nobody's contributions should ever go unnoticed or undervalued, especially entering an age where food sustainability will be of humanitarian importance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Industrialization through factory farming and mass production illuminates the importance of addressing a balance between sustainable practices and efficiency. Throughout the Industrial Revolution's history, a disregard for waste has been ever-occurring, leading to immense ramifications in our soil and climate, issues still plaguing us today. Adapting from these issues means restoring balance to our food production scales to ensure we usher in an unprecedented age of biodiversity and environmental preservation while allowing for high-quality food to be enjoyed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Humanity is at a crossroads; through our historical lens, we find ourselves with the tools and knowledge to repair the issues of food sustainability. Resilience through community, sustainable local agriculture, gender equality, and representation despite class differences ensure that our food is not only sustainable for us but also for future generations.
